## File Structure
 - index.html: The primary HTML file that defines the structure of the web page.

 - Category filter buttons (<button type="button" onclick="filterProducts(category)">) allow users to filter products based on different categories: electronic, jewelry, men's clothing, and women's clothing.
 - The main product container (<section class="product-container">) will display the filtered products.
